# This section defines the build settings (optional, but good practice)
[build]

  # Change 'dist' to 'build' or whatever your build tool uses if necessary
  publish = "dist"
  # Specify the command to run your build
  command = "npm run build"

# This section defines the redirect rules
[[redirects]]
  # The path to capture (any path that doesn't match a file)
  from = "/*"
  # The destination to redirect to (your main index file)
  to = "/index.html"
  # The status code (200 preserves the URL in the browser bar)
  status = 200
  # Ensure the rule only applies when a file is NOT found
